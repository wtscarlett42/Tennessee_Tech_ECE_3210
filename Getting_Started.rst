Installing Scientific Python
----------------------------

- Students should have `Anaconda Python`_, Python version 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8, installed (64 bit is correct for any reasonably recent machine). **There won't be time to do this at the start of the short class!!!** I may have an alternative live during the course, but it won't get your machine working!

- When doing this *also install Visual Studio Code*. It is an option near the end. It's a great code editor that you should try if you write a lot of code.

- Just install anything it asks you about. It's all good stuff.

- Users should install locally (not for all users) to keep things simple.

- All platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux) will be covered below.

Step 1:

- **Windows and Mac**: Download `GitHub Desktop`_ and install it. You may need to create an account on GitHub.

- **Linux users**: Follow the MacOS instructions. The Mac is unix too.

  - You will need to use `GitKraken`_.

    - Good News: It's much more powerful.

    - Bad News: It's much more complicated.

    - I need to leave it to you to read up on how to use it. I'll try to add instructions later.

- Go to `the repository for this class in your web browser`_.

Two paths
~~~~~~~~~

- **Less capable/simpler**

  - You should be able to see a green button that says ``Clone or Download``. ``Clone`` is much better. ``Clone`` it. This will allow you to update it in the future when I update my notes. Download means you reorganize each time. I suggest you create a folder ``GitHub`` in your Documents folder.

  - This method *should* allow you to add cells and notes in the notebook. They *should* be retained when you update in Github. I'm not 100% sure.


- **More capable/more complex**

  - This method will allow you to update *my* notes or code. You might want two repositories. One as above, and one like this where you **don't** put your notes, but you *do* improve my notes/code.

  - Near the top right of the web page, *fork* the code. You will get a new repository of your own duplicating the one for the class.

  - Go to your version of the notes and clone that repository to your computer (per the less capable instructions above).

  - Work with this on your computer as below.

  - You will want to update this repository **on GitHub** from time to time.

  - Use the GitHub application (on your computer) to:

    a. Keep your local repository matching the one on Github

    b. Push your improvements on your local computer to GitHub.com

  - On GitHub.com, `submit a pull request`_ to ask me to pull your improvements into my notes. Don't worry, you can't break my notes in my repository.



Platform Differences
--------------------

Fundamentally, theses instructions are the same. The challenge is most users may not have used a terminal before.
Further, Anaconda sets up your terminal to work well for you.

These are step-by-step to walk you through what needs to happen in the terminal for each platform.

Windows Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Find the Anaconda Prompt application and run it. Answer *yes* to all prompts. Don't do anything it advises against.
- Type ``conda update --all``
- Open ``Anaconda Terminal``
- You need to get to the right directory in Anaconda Terminal. There are two methods. The first is better long-term. The second is faster to get started. It's about learning the command line.

  - Method 1. (Useful to learn, maybe not necessary today)

    - Move into the appropriate directory.

      - This is done using the ``cd`` command. In the ``File Explorer`` go inside the folder with the cloned repository.

      - You know you are in the right place when you see ``Calc_Review.ipynb``.

      - Near the top of the window you can see the entire path.

      - This is your path. It will look something like ``C:\MyComputer\Users\Myname\GitHub\Introduction_to_Scientific_Python``. It depends on a lot of decisions you've made in the past and presently. This is called your path.

      - Get the right names and type ``cd `` *path from above*. This is all one line. The *path from above* is exactly what you read off the top of your window two bullets above.

      - There may be something like ``Documents`` or such embedded. You need to figure this path out.

      - Typing ``dir`` should provide a list of files that include ``Calc_Review.ipynb``

  - Method 2. (Quick way but lacking power)

    - In the GitHub Desktop (app), select the repository ``Introduction_to_Python``.

    - On the right it will (may- I haven't checked) provide options, one of which is ``open in Anaconda Terminal``.

    - This, plus the ``cd`` command (cd both changes directory when there is a directory after it, or tells you the directory if there is not.) can tell you where everything is.
- Type ``conda env update --file environment.yml``

- Get to this directory when you want to run the course material (maybe now, maybe later) and type:

  - ``jupyter notebook``, or for a more sophisticated environment,

  - ``jupyter lab`` (interaction is less reliable, I've found).


Mac Users
~~~~~~~~~

- Find the ``Terminal.app``. It is located in your ``/Applications/Utilities`` folder. Answer *yes* to all prompts.

  - Quick tip- command-key space-bar, then type 'Terminal' may launch it if Spotlight is set up correctly.

- Type ``conda update --all``
- Open your terminal application.

  - For Mac, look inside your ``Applications`` folder, inside ``Utilities`` and run ``Terminal``

  - On Linux, you likely already know which one you like (or why are you using Linux?).

- Move into the appropriate directory

  - Method 1. (Useful to learn, not necessary today)

    - Move into the appropriate directory.

      - This is done using the ``cd`` command. In the ``Finder`` go inside the folder with the cloned repository.

      - You know you are in the right place when you see ``Calc_Review.ipynb``.

      - Hold the ``Command`` key and click on the folder icon at the top of the window. It's to the left of ``Introduction_to_Python``.

      - This is your path. It will look something like ``/MyComputer/Users/Myname/GitHub/Introduction_to_Python``. It depends on a lot of decisions you've made in the past and presently.

      - Get the right names and type ``cd /MyComputer/Users/Myname/GitHub/Introduction_to_Python``.

      - There may be something like ``Documents`` or such embedded. You need to figure this path out.

      - Typing ``ls`` should provide a list of files that include ``Calc_Review.ipynb`` and ``Introduction_to_Scientific_Python.ipynb``.

  - Method 2. (Quick way but lacking power)

    - In the GitHub Desktop (app), select the repository ``Introduction_to_Python``. (sorry- I have some inconsistencies where "Scientific" is missing. I cannot fix them without breaking things.)

    - On the right it will provide options, one of which is ``open in terminal``.

    - This, plus the ``pwd`` command (present working directory) can tell you where everything is.

- Type ``conda env update --file environment.yml``

- Get to this same directory when you want to run the course material (maybe now, maybe later) and type one of:

  - ``jupyter notebook``, or for a more sophisticated environment,

  - ``jupyter lab`` (interaction is less reliable, I've found).

If we have time, we will learn a little Bokeh (probably not)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are notes to myself... you might figure them out, you need to know how to hunt paths, though.

``bokeh serve /Users/jslater/Documents/python-dev/bokeh/examples/app/taylor.py``

``jupyter notebook /Users/jslater/Documents/python-dev/bokeh-notebooks/quickstart``
